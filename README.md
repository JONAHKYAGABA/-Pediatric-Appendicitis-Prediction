# 🏥 Pediatric Appendicitis Prediction

This project explores machine learning-based prediction of acute appendicitis in pediatric patients using clinical features. The dataset is derived from pediatric emergency department visits, with the goal of supporting early and accurate diagnostic decision-making.

## 📊 Project Goals

- Use clinical features to classify patients as having appendicitis or not.
- Evaluate various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Analyze feature importance and model performance using AUC and F1-score metrics.
- Generate visualizations and a performance comparison table.
